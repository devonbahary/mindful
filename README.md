## Many Interests, One Place to Track Them

It's no secret I carry notebooks in my backpack. Each one has a piece of tape on the front with a sharpie label: *[48 Laws of Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_48_Laws_of_Power)*, *React*, *[Self-Reliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Reliance)*, *Node*, etc.

I'm a practitioner of **writing down findings related to my various topics of interest**. I feel like they stick better in my memory that way, and instead of trying to recall something from a vague page number and parsing through all the dense information, I can just reach for the appropriate notebook and scan through an organized list of notable findings.

Since I was already doing this with old-fashioned pen and paper, I figured why not **make an app to explore how to make this better**?

## Create Topics
![Noteable Dashboard](/assets/img/DashboardMobile.png)

**[Noteable](http://noteable1.herokuapp.com/)** starts with **Topics**.

Got a new interest? Create a new **topic**.

## Take Notes

![Noteable Topic](/assets/img/TopicMobile.png)

Scroll through the list of **notes** you've taken about the topic, or use the **search function** to narrow down what you're looking for.

**Notes** can be in the form of **text** or a **list**, with or without a title (for further organization).

## Modeling After Successful Implementations

**Google** already has a successful implementation of **[Noteable's](http://noteable1.herokuapp.com/)** concept called **[Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/)**, which I admittedly use.

In fact, I've modeled **[Noteable](http://noteable1.herokuapp.com/)** after the UI design of **Google Keep**.

Developing **[Noteable](http://noteable1.herokuapp.com/)** has been a fun exercise in taking a polished UI design and mocking it up from scratch.

It's even been inspiring in moments when I found myself lacking artistic creativity (don't tell anyone, but I'm much better at copying from something pretty than reliably coming up with something pretty on my own)!


## Making It My Own

I've admitted to using **Google Keep**, but it functions best as a digital Post-it note collection rather than as a means of **organizing disparate information**.

If you want to organize your information in **Google Keep** such that all notes related to one another are in one accessible place, your best bet is to keep **ALL** of that information in **ONE** note and title it appropriately.

Clearly this gets **long** and **unparseable**.

This inspired the idea of **topics** in **[Noteable](http://noteable1.herokuapp.com/)**, and is where **[Noteable](http://noteable1.herokuapp.com/)** takes its departure from **Google Keep**: each **topic** serves as a sort-of fresh page of **Google Keep**, and each **note** then serves as its own instance of information.

This way **all my related information belongs in one topic**, but each note can serve as its own unit of information!

## Where To Go From Here

My girlfriend's recently far surpassed me in her book-reading: she's reading a whopping one book every month. I totally encourage this habit, and I find myself **benefiting from it too** because I ask her on a regular basis what interesting things she's learned from her last readings.

And so it came to me: **what if you could share your findings with others as you came across them?**

I think this could add a **social element** to **[Noteable](http://noteable1.herokuapp.com/)** for those who would be interested in opting in to it!
- Give an interesting fact your friend just uploaded a **nod**, or even **write a message** in response to it!
- Keep up to date with whatever your close circle is currently exploring and **learn together** in proximal collaboration!
